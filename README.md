# Assignment 2 - Python List Operations

This project demonstrates basic list operations in Python. It sequentially performs tasks such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an element in a list.

## 📁 File

- `Assignment2.py`: Contains Python code that manipulates a list through a series of operations.

## 🧠 What It Does

The script:
1. Creates an empty list.
2. Appends elements: `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`.
3. Inserts `15` at the second position (index 1).
4. Extends the list with: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`.

## ✅ Expected Output

Index of 30: 4


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python Assignment2.py
